# hello-world

So, here's the story: 
I accidentally edited the README file in the main branch. 
I was supposed to do this in the branch called readme-edits. 

Then, in the GitHub introductory tutorial, I was 
supposed to be able to merge my pull request, but there was 
a conflict. 

After clicking on 'Resolve conflict', I was sent to the file where:

<< readme-edits 
My (honest) first non-empty repository. 

Hey, I guess I made a mistake. 
I edited this file earlier, but I guess I was in the main branch. 
Ah well, I learn the most from mistakes!
=========
My first GitHub repository. 

I have so much fun learning about things. 
So much fun, indeed. 
>> master (but with more of the arrowheads)

was depicted. I think this was to indicate that these blocks of
lines in the files on each branch were conflicting and hence 
could not be merged. 

It makes me wonder...how does merging work if I were to edit a file?

Naturally, changes will be made. E.g., say I have a LaTeX file I'm editing 
with friends. I may delete stuff, add stuff, correct stuff, etc. How do
such files get merged? My guess is that you start with an "empty" file. 
You only make changes and update the main file when changes get discussed
and resolved through pull requests.
